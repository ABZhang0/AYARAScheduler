# AYARAScheduler

Based off of an implementation of Schemetrical's UBC Course Scheduler, adapted to Vanderbilt University's YES website with additional features.

Things you can do:

-	add courses and auto generate schedules
- add laboratories associated with the lecture courses to the timetable
-	restrict courses based on time blocks to reduce possibilities
-	lock sections in position to reduce possibilities

Things it can't do (yet):

-	Filter by status (if sections are full)
-	mouseover popup with more detailed course info (instructor, length, activities)
-	auto enroll (bypassing YES) in selected timetable
-	generate feedback for impossible schedules (no sections or times available, etc.)
